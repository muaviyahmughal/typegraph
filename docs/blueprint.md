## Original User Request:
A web app aimed at graphic/type designers for experimental graphic/type design which involves working with manipulating and applying effects to fonts/typefaces such as, but not limited to:
-turning the letters to bitmap and applying pixelation effects in various ways
-turning the letters to ASCII art
-able to smudge letters with various smudge effects and apply liquifying effects
-turning the structure of letters as if they are made of horizontal or vertical strokes/lines
-applying various styles of stippling, halftone and other shading techniques to the letters
-turning letters into various matrix styles such as matrix LEDs

All these effects must be vector where possible and be able to export in their respective file types (or chosen formats). The app would have a menu to apply and control these effects as well as import/export options. The app would have a canvas area where the user can type and format text with options like bold, font size, paragraph options, kerning options etc. The app would let user to either upload font files in the workspace or fetch from installed fonts in the system. Whatever the case, the app would then let user choose current working font from a dropdown.
